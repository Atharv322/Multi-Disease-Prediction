# 🩺 Multi-Disease-Prediction

This project is a Streamlit-based Machine Learning Web Application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases based on user-input health parameters. The system currently supports 6 disease predictions:

1. Diabetes Prediction

2. Heart Disease Prediction

3. Parkinson’s Disease Prediction

4. Breast Cancer Prediction

5. Liver Disease Prediction

6. Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

## 🚀 Features

📊 User-friendly Streamlit Web App

⚡ Fast & Interactive Predictions

🧠 Machine Learning Models trained using Scikit-learn

🧾 Input form for each disease with relevant medical parameters

🌍 Runs locally or can be deployed on Streamlit Cloud
